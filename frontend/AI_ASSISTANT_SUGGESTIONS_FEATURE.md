# 🎉 AI Assistant - Suggested Questions Feature

## ✨ What's New?

Your AI Assistant now shows **4 clickable suggested questions** after each response. Users can click on any suggestion to get the exact answer without typing!

## 🎯 How It Works

### **1. Initial Greeting**

When the chat opens, users see 4 initial suggestions:

```
💡 Show me all tours
💡 Tours to Goa
💡 Weekend packages
💡 Best deals
```

### **2. Dynamic Suggestions**

After every AI response, contextual suggestions appear based on what the AI just said:

**When tours are found:**

- "Tell me more about [Tour Name]"
- "What's the itinerary for this tour?"
- "Show me availability for [Tour Name]"
- "Compare different tours"
- "Show tours by price"

**When no tours found:**

- "Show me all available tours"
- "Tours under ₹50,000"
- "Popular destinations"
- "Weekend getaways"

**For general questions:**

- "Show me tours to Goa"
- "Best deals available"
- "Weekend getaways"
- "How to book?"

### **3. One-Click Responses**

Users simply click a suggestion button → AI instantly processes it and shows relevant results with new suggestions!
