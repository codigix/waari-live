---

## ✨ Features Implemented

### 1. **Smart Context Memory** 🧠

Tracks user preferences throughout conversation:

```javascript
{
  budget: "budget" | "mid-range" | "premium"
  duration: "2-3 days" | "4-5 days" | "6-8 days" | "10+ days"
  activityType: "Adventure" | "Beach" | "Cultural" | "Mountain"
  groupType: "Couple" | "Family" | "Solo" | "Group"
  destination: "Goa" | "Kerala" | "Delhi" | etc.
}
```

### 2. **Intelligent Preference Extraction** 🔍

Automatically detects user preferences from queries:

**Budget Detection:**

- "under ₹25k" → budget
- "₹25k to ₹50k" → mid-range
- "premium/luxury" → premium

**Duration Detection:**

- "2-3 days" / "weekend" → 2-3 days
- "4-5 days" → 4-5 days
- "week" → 6-8 days
- "10+ days" → 10+ days

**Activity Type Detection:**

- "adventure/trek/hike" → Adventure
- "beach/relax" → Beach
- "culture/heritage/temple" → Cultural
- "mountain/himalayas" → Mountain

**Group Type Detection:**

- "couple/honeymoon" → Couple
- "family/kids" → Family
- "solo/alone" → Solo
- "friends/group" → Group

### 3. **Strategic Follow-up Questions** 💬

Smart questions asked based on missing user information:

```
Missing Budget?
→ "What's your budget range?"
  [💰 Budget] [💳 Mid-range] [💎 Premium]

Missing Duration?
→ "How many days do you have?"
  [⏰ 2-3 days] [📅 4-5 days] [🎒 6-8 days] [🏖️ 10+ days]

Missing Activity Type?
→ "What type of experience?"
  [🏖️ Beach] [🏔️ Mountain] [🎪 Culture] [⛰️ Adventure]
```

### 4. **Interactive Filter Buttons** 🎯

Quick-click options instead of typing:

- Styled with purple border (primary theme)
- Hover effect for better UX
- Responsive design for mobile
- Easy preference selection

### 5. **Context-Aware Suggestions** 🎁

Suggestions adapt based on user preferences:

**Example Flow:**

```
User: "Show me tours to Goa"
Bot: [Extracts: destination=Goa]
     Suggestions:
     - "Show me adventure tours to Goa"
     - "Tell me about pricing options"
     - "What activities are included?"
     - "How do I book a tour?"

User: "Budget 30k"
Bot: [Extracts: budget=mid-range]
     Updated Suggestions:
     - "30k mid-range trip to Goa"
     - "What activities are included?"
     - "When are tours available?"
     - "Tell me about accommodation"
```
